Common interfaces and types for typescript, such `Predicate` or `Maybe`. This is of no use if you do not use typescript.
I made this because I often ended up needing and writing the same types for my projects.

Types are used only when transpiling, they do not end up in the transpiled code. Ie, your 
transpiled code does not get bigger by using this library.

# Documentation
[Documentation and list of all the interfaces and types.](https://blutorange.github.io/js-andross/)

# Install

The drill:

```sh
npm install --save andross
```

Now you can import the types 

# Usage

All available and types are exposed from the main file.

```typescript
// import this lib
import { Predicate, Maybe, Comparator } from "andross";

// Use the interfaces and type.
class Users<T> {
  private users: Users[];
  constructor() {
    this.users = [];    
  }
  getUserById(id: number): Maybe<User> {
    return this.users.find(user => user.id === id);
  }
  getUsers(filter: Predicate<User>): User[] {
    return this.users.filter(filter);
  }
  sort(comparator: Comparator<T>) {
    this.users.sort(comparator);
  }
}
```

# Enums

As of version 0.3.4, this package also includes some predefined enumerations. Since these are not purely type definitions and contribute to
the size of a bundle, they are placed in a separate file and not included in the main file:

```typescript
import { CardinalDirection4 } from "andross/enum";
const north = CardinalDirection4.North;
```

See the [documentation](https://blutorange.github.io/js-andross/) for a list of all interfaces and types with a short description.

# Changes

- 0.3.7 Added types `ReversibleFunction`, `ReversibleBiFunction`, `ReversibleTriFunction`.
- 0.3.6 Added type `Equatable` and added defaults for type parameters of `BiConsumer`/`TriConsumer` and `BiSupplier`/`TriSupplier`.
- 0.3.5 Added an optional type parameter `K` to `StringObject`, allowing you to restrict the available keys. Also removed the `*.ts` source files from the NPM package. The source file made webpack with `ts-loader` work incorrectly.
- 0.3.4 Added types `RectSize`, `Rectangle`, `MinMaxRectangle`, `CardinalDirection4/8/16/32`, `ReadonlyFor`, `ReadonlyExcept`, `MatchingKeys`.
- 0.3.3 Added types `PartialExcept` (makes every property but the given optional) and `PartialFor` (makes every given property optional).
- 0.3.2 Added `RemoveFrom`. Tuple types generics now default to the previous type, ie. `Pair<string>` is equivalent to `Pair<string, string>`.
- 0.3.1 Added `Builder` type.
- 0.3.0 Added Vector types (`Vector1`, `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Vector4`, `Vector5`), `StringObject` and `NumberObject`, as well as `Omit` and `Overwrite`
- 0.2.0 Added JSON types.
